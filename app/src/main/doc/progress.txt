Java domain classes, Port, Crossing, Premises, RoadStage, Location, Route, Stage.

Code to create instances of the above classes and link them together.

Implemented a decision tree to find the optimal route between a premises in Ireland and England.

Researched into a cloud platform for our REST server. choose Heroku as it's easy to build a Java REST service and deploy to Heroku. 
Heroku uses PostGres for the database. Installed and started using PostGres.

Designed database schema (Port and Crossing tables). Wrote the Data Access Object classes. PortDAO, CrossingDAO, random test code.
Eventually these will run on the server side. (I've still to handle start and end times for Crossings).
